	<h1>Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon</h1>	
	<h2><u>Why</u>:</h2>
	<p>I saw Stanley Kubrick's <b>Barry Lyndon</b> three days in a row since it was just such a tremendous film to me in terms of the overall presentation.</p>
	<p>With each viewing, I took away enough new information that I found mini films within the three hour odyssey.</p>
